# Clue Advanced Scorecard
## Use a Digital Scorecard for the Clue Board Game and Win Almost Every Time

Chandler Stevens presents the Clue Advanced Scorecard application.

This app "hacks" the board game Clue by keeping track of every rumor made.
Therefore, the computer can rapidly use logic to discover the 3 secret cards.

1. Simply select which edition of Clue you will be playing.
2. Select the cards you have in your hand.
3. Enter the initials of your opponents.
4. Specify if there are any extra cards.
5. Then, for each rumor:
- Select which player is guessing.
- Select which cards the player is guessing.
- Select which player responded.
6. Then, the program automatically updates the scorecard with new insights!
